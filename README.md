# Assignment-2
1. SDG and Problem
SDG 11 â€“ Sustainable Cities and Communities
Problem: Inefficient waste collection and poor urban planning result in waste accumulation in certain neighborhoods, leading to public health and environmental risks.

2. ML Approach
Unsupervised Learning using K-Means Clustering

We will cluster urban neighborhoods based on:

Waste generation rates

Population density

Frequency of waste collection

Access to recycling facilities

This will help city officials identify hotspots and optimize waste collection routes and frequency.

3. Dataset & Tools
âœ… Dataset:
Source: Kaggle - Municipal Waste Dataset

Alternate: UN SDG Data, World Bank Open Data

The dataset includes:

Neighborhood ID

Monthly waste (kg)

Population

Collection frequency

Recycling participation (%)

âœ… Tools:
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

4. Model Building
âœ… Step 1: Preprocess Data
Handle missing values

Normalize numerical features

Convert categorical data (if any)

Drop irrelevant columns

âœ… Step 2: Train Model
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
Use StandardScaler to normalize

Run KMeans with k=3 to 5 (optimize using silhouette score)

âœ… Step 3: Evaluate
Use Silhouette Score to evaluate clusters

Visualize with PCA or t-SNE to show 2D cluster separation

5. Ethical Reflection
Bias Consideration: Some neighborhoods may have underreported data due to informal waste collection or lack of infrastructure.

Fairness and Sustainability: This clustering model promotes equitable waste management by helping cities allocate more resources to underserved areas, improving health and environmental outcomes.

**SDG Addressed:** SDG 11 â€“ Sustainable Cities  
**ML Technique:** K-Means clustering for neighborhood waste pattern analysis  
**Results:** Identified 3 neighborhood clusters:
  - High-density & high-waste
  - Low-density & infrequent pickup
  - Moderate-density & active recycling

**Ethical Consideration:** The model highlights areas often neglected in data and can help governments intervene fairly to reduce health risks and promote environmental sustainability.

Summary of impact and ethical reflection

ðŸŒŸ Stretch Goal (Optional)
Build a Streamlit app to allow users to upload waste data and get cluster analysis.

Integrate a city map API to visually display cluster regions on a map.
